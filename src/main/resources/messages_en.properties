auditoria.mensaje2=At this time we do not have any audits listed
reporte.reporte=Report
noticia.noticia1=Catalunya Wagen implements the 5'S
noticia.noticia2=Promoted by its new After Sales Director, \u00c1ngel Rodr\u00edguez, Catalunya Wagen has launched its 5S plan. Under this enigmatic name hides a work philosophy that, ultimately, will improve the satisfaction of our customers. The 5S are a creation of the Japanese production system that is causing a furore in Western companies. Applied to our workshops, it means following a series of rules that tend to improve order, organization and cleanliness in the workplace, in such a way that the well-being of the operators is increased and the productivity of the After-Sales Service is improved.
noticia.noticia3=AyA and the 5S at work
noticia.noticia4=Recently, the 5S Program has begun to be reported and tried to be applied in the institution. It is a methodology created in Japan in the 1960s by the Toyota company, whose objective is to improve working conditions aimed at minimizing waste, with a view to ensuring that the work space is systematically clean and tidy and with which to improve productivity and safety, while creating continuous efficient, effective and effective processes in order to promote an organized and highly motivated environment. The conceptual and practical tools that are intended to achieve this goal are: Seiri (eliminate everything unnecessary and clear your work table), Seiton (organize the workspace effectively), Seiso (not dirty), Seiketsu (establish procedures and work methods) and Shitsuke (respect work rules through continuity and perseverance).

pf.linea1=FQA1. What are 5S?
pf.linea2=The "5S" are the initials of five Japanese words that name each of the five phases that make up the method:
pf.linea3=SEIRI \u2013 CLASSIFICATION. It consists of identifying and separating the necessary materials from the unnecessary ones and getting rid of the latter.
pf.linea4=SEITON \u2013 ORDER. It is about establishing the way in which the necessary materials should be located and identified, so that it is easy and fast to find, use and replace them.
pf.linea5=SEISO \u2013 CLEANING. Based on identifying and eliminating sources of dirt, ensuring that all media are always in perfect condition.
pf.linea6=SEIKETSU \u2013 STANDARDIZATION. The objective is to easily distinguish a normal situation from an abnormal one, by means of simple and visible rules for all, giving rise to a visual control.
pf.linea7=SHITSUKE \u2013 DISCIPLINE. It consists of working permanently in accordance with the established norms.
pf.linea8=FQA2. What are its advantages?
pf.linea9=Higher productivity.
pf.linea10=Improves working conditions, increasing safety levels and reducing accidents.
pf.linea11=Reduction of time losses and shorter response times.
pf.linea12=Improvement in the quality of products and/or services.
pf.linea13=Low level of investment to achieve its implementation.
pf.linea14=Generates organizational culture and personal discipline.
pf.linea15=FQA3. Who is the 5s method for?
pf.linea16=The 5S are universal, they can be applied in all types of companies and organizations, both in workshops and offices, even in those that apparently are sufficiently tidy and clean. Therefore, any type of organization, whether industrial or service, that wants to start the path of continuous improvement can implement it in areas such as the maintenance of assets and facilities.
pf.linea17=FQA4. What are the methodological requirements of the 5S?
pf.linea18=The commitment and participation of personnel at different levels of the organization, especially management. "As long as top management does not give its clear and determined support [...] the project will not be feasible" (Stryker, in Garfield, 1992, p. 197).
pf.linea19=The existing work culture in the organization can speed up or slow down the adoption of new ways of working that require 5S (Robinns, 1999).
pf.linea20=The availability of time and its administration. Care must be taken that the process is not too slow or too long, as this can increase costs and decrease staff motivation and perceived benefits. Imai (1989, p. 121) points out that "a manager must dedicate at least 50% of his time to improvement" and, in the implementation of the 5S, his active and continuous participation is crucial to optimize the use of the weather.
pf.linea21=FQA5. What are the objectives of the 5S?
pf.linea22=Serve as feedback for evaluation of the implementation plan
pf.linea23=Present improvement opportunities for the audited areas
pf.linea24=Measure the current level of 5S to later evaluate its evolution in your company
pf.linea25=Check the current level of 5S to compare with the established goal
pf.linea26=Serve as a tool for continuous promotion of the 5S
pf.linea27=Compare the evolution of the 5S process throughout the company
pf.linea28=Verify the level of consolidation of the implementation of the 5S
material.linea1=Is it difficult for you to organize? The 5S method is for you
material.linea2=Looking for a way to get organized? Have you already tried various methods and they have not given you an effect? That's why we offer you another option, this time the 5S basic and simple principles to achieve your goals.
material.linea3=Go to guide 1
material.linea4=What is 5S?
material.linea5=5S is a systematic form of visual management that uses everything from floor tape to operations manuals. It's not just about cleanliness and organization; it is also about maximizing efficiency and profit. 5S is a framework that emphasizes the use of a specific mindset and tools to create efficiency and value. It involves observing, analyzing, collaborating and searching for waste, and it also involves the practice of removing waste.

material.linea7=GUIDE PROPOSAL BASED ON THE 5S TECHNIQUE AS A BASIC TOOL TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WAREHOUSE OF THE SEMAP REGIONAL UNIT
material.linea8=Due to globalization, currently improving quality and productivity is essential for a company to remain in the market. However, to begin this improvement process, it is essential to start with a change in habits, methods and approach that strengthen discipline, order and cooperation among all members of an organization. Through the 5s technique, as a methodology aimed at achieving more productive, pleasant and safe spaces, it is possible to achieve this.
material.linea9=Go to guide 3
material.linea10=5'S Implementation Manual
material.linea11=The 5 S can be developed with some independence from the SGC, which will constitute an awareness springboard to subsequently launch this action. In any case, the success of the 5S and its perpetuity require a total commitment on the part of the operational personnel as well as the hierarchical line to induce a change in the state of mind, attitude and behavior of the organization, which guarantees the process of implementation of Total Quality Management. This manual will serve to guide all staff, in the implementation (techniques, procedures and audits of the 5 S) and especially the deputy directors and heads of offices who will assume a role of facilitators within their work areas, motivating your staff to ensure the success of the program.
